"koi jao?" <br>
"balcony te, aktu boshbo"<br>
I step out with my phone and earphones in hand. Sat on my mini couch; something my mum and I built together. The air burns through my lungs as I take a deep breath. I sit, plug in my earphones, and let the first notes of _Roi_ drift through. My eyes lifts towards the starry night. I will probably never get over how beautiful the night is in winter. 

Leaning back, countless thoughts start to rush in. My chest feels heavy. Breathing gets a bit harder. I close my eyes and let the chilly air continue to burn me. Flashes of memories.. too vivid, too loud. It feels too much to take. 

The cold bites. The music hums. A faint star wavers. I exhale, slow and uneven. Chest hurts. I stay still, letting the thoughts pull me under. As I prepare myself to reread everything.
