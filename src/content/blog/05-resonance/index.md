in prayers, I find my Lord <br>
in reflection, I find strength<br>
in agony, I find courage<br>
in woe, I find beauty<br>
in stars, I find dreams<br>
in books, I find escape<br>
in eyes, I find stories<br>
in yours, I find future<br>
in love, I find confinement<br>
in loathe, I find love<br>
in solitude, I find myself<br> 
in company, I hope to find you<br>
