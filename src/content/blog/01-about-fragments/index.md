Fragments is a series of small pieces/fragment I write. They are mostly based on my personal experiences & imaginations. Some fragments are written very carefully, some are written in one go. It doesn't matter either way. This series is, above all, a form of catharsis- a way for me to capture fleeting thoughts and memories before they fade away 🕯️
