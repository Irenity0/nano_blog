「I am the only living thing in this world. 」

A lonely voice.

“You bastard... don’t fall into those sentiments.”

I shouted while blocking his sword.

“If you can’t find the meaning of life in front of you, didn’t you decide to live for the greater cause?”

\[The exclusive skill, ‘Fourth Wall’ is activated!]

I didn’t know who I was talking to anymore. Hot flames sprang up from the blade. My eyes stung and my skin became raw from the heat. My voice was breathless. Maybe I was also lost in the moment.

「 I am alone. 」

It was as if I was Yoo Jonghyuk or even lived Yoo Jonghyuk’s life. My chest was tight.

“Alone?”

「 I... 」

“What did I come here for if you are alone?”   

「 I... 」

My sword struck and tore at his hands. Blood flowed and the flesh was torn. I wielded the sword like a madman. I gritted my teeth.

“Why are you alone? When you died like a fool in the Theatre Dungeon, when you cried over your dead little sister, when the prophet stabbed you in the back! When your loved one gave birth to a child...!”

As I was talking, I strangely recalled other memories. Letters and letters passed. My old memories of Ways of Survival.

“You went crazy after your child died!”

The complex memories of his family affairs and things he experienced passed through my mind.

“Fighting against the demon kings and the returnees!”

The nightmares of the senior officers in the army.

“Helping people and fighting against the damn reincarnators! When you finally stood before the constellations!”

The days when I struggled to get a job and when my bosses were vile and abusive. Everything was in order to live. In order to survive every day.

**“*Look around you and try to live somehow!*"**

Even so, I returned home. I felt relieved when reading one novel.

“I...”

My hand holding the blade trembled. I became too excited. Dammit. I just needed to buy enough time.

I breathed roughly and looked ahead. But...something was strange. Was it an illusion? It was only a moment but a dim light was returning to Yoo Jonghyuk’s hand.

「 I... 」

Some things couldn’t be understood even if I read his mind. My heart thumped the moment I saw Yoo Jonghyuk’s look.

\[The excessive immersion has caused the ‘Fourth Wall’ to shake.]

Yoo Jonghyuk’s eyes were staring straight at me.

「 You... who are you? 」
