Oh, to be loved <br>
like the stars love the sky<br>
like a reader love the book<br>
like a paintbrush love the canvas<br>
like a paper love the ink<br>
like a ocean kiss the shore<br>
like a heart want to be loved<br>
like a flame crave the air<br>
like a song love the voice<br>

Oh, to be loved<br>
like a cage love the bird<br>
like a needle love the skin<br>
like the poison love the vein<br>
like the thorn love the rose<br>
like a nightmare love the dreamer<br>
like a dagger kiss the wound<br>
like a mask hide the face<br>
like a grave crave a body<br>
