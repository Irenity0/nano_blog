can I rest on your shoulder for a while? I am tired. I am sorry. You don't have to be here always. You don't have to talk. I just need a presence. A presence, enough can comfort me. A few words of comfort could have helped the younger me. But now, nothing really reaches me anymore. I am too tired to feel. I just need to rest a bit. Can you give me a moment of comfort before I continue to hurt again? You can disappear after it. And I will be grateful to you forever.
