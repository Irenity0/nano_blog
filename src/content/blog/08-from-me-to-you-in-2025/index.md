I am not sure of what I want to say to you. I hope you are doing okay. Of course, you are. You always do. Things get hard but you get through them anyway. Nights will continue to feel empty as ever. Thoughts will come rushing over you without any notice. You shall continue to suffer; through these moments. You will be dying. Over and over again. And when you are reborn, you shall be shining brighter than ever. Like a star shines the brightest before it dies. I trust you. I know you. More than anyone on this earth will ever know you. You shan't fall down. You won't. Unless He, the One and Only, want you to fall. Even when He wishes so, I know that, even your fall will be as graceful as ever. You are you. And I am always beside you. You must not forget it. At times, you will feel conflicted. Do not fear and turn to your God. He shall guide you, as always.
