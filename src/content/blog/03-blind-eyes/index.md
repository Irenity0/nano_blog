These hands of mine hold the power to create, destroy & to leave a mark on the world. a quiet reminder of the choices I have made and those yet to come. They carry the weight of my actions and the depth of my imagination. With them, I shape my destiny.

These hands of mine carry traces of all that I have touched—both built and undone. They are a quiet reminder of the paths I’ve walked, the worlds I’ve imagined, and the dreams I’ve left behind. In their stillness, they hold potential; in their movement, they leave marks that ripple beyond what I can see. Each action, however small, shapes something—whether in me or around me. These hands are both tools and witnesses, shaping a story that's solely mine.
