The **Observer Effect** refers to the idea that observing a system or phenomenon can alter its behavior or state. It’s commonly discussed in physics but applies to other fields as well.

### Key Examples:

1. **Physics**: In quantum mechanics, observing particles like electrons can change their position or momentum. This is tied to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
2. **Everyday Life**: People act differently when they know they’re being watched, like employees performing better under supervision.
3. **Science**: Measuring temperature with a thermometer slightly changes the temperature of the object being measured.

### Why It Happens:

Observation often involves interacting with the system being studied. For example:

- Light or tools used to observe can disturb particles.
- Human awareness or presence influences behavior.

In short, observing something is rarely passive—it often affects the very thing being observed.
